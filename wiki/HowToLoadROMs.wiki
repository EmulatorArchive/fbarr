#summary How to load ROMs in FBA.

There are special ROMs that work with FBA. They are usually called Final Burn Alpha ROMs or FBA ROMs.

The ROMs must remain zipped and be placed in the Roms folder of FBA.

Once that is done, load FBA, and load game. A red strikethrough icon means the game cannot be played. If you try to load a game which cannot be played, it will tell you which ROMs you need.
